    "## Introduction\n",
    "Amazon Textract is a machine learning (ML) service that automatically extracts text, handwriting, and data from scanned documents. It goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to identify, understand, and extract data from forms and tables. In this session we will demonstrate how to programatically use Amazon Textract to solve common intelligent document processing challenges such as: detecting text within a document, analyzing a document for relationships between detected items, using asynchronous operations for batch processing, analyzing a document for financially-related relationships between text, and more.\n",

    "3. Once the job status is no longer IN_PROGRESS, we again attempt to get the job results - using the JobId - by calling the get_document_analysis function, this time via our get_job_results() helper function).\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: We don't recommend getting the request completion status by repeatedly calling the Amazon Textract Get operation. This is because Amazon Textract throttles the Get operation if too many requests are made. If you're processing multiple documents at the same time, it's simpler and more efficient to monitor one SQS queue for the completion notification than to poll Amazon Textract for the status of each job individually.
