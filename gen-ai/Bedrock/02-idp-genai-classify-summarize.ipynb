IDP has become increasingly important for businesses as they seek to extract valuable insights from their documents and streamline document-centric processes.\n",

Document classification involves categorizing documents based on their content, enabling efficient routing and processing. Document summarization, on the other hand, aims to generate concise summaries of lengthy documents, allowing for quick understanding of their contents.\n",
