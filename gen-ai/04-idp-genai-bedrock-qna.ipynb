The Plan Administrator has retained the services of independent Third Party Administrators to process claims and handle other duties for this self-funded Plan. The Third Party Administrators for this Plan are UMR, Inc. (hereinafter \"UMR\") for medical claims, and Express Scripts for pharmacy claims . Amounts the Covered Person Incurs for Covered Expenses will be used to satisfy the Covered Person's (or family's, if applicable) annual out-of-pocket maximum(s). If the Covered Person's out-of-pocket expenses in a Plan Year exceed the annual out-of-pocket maximum, the Plan pays 100% of the Covered Expenses through the end of the Plan Year. The following will not be used to meet the out-of-pocket maximums: _Penalties, legal fees and interest charged by a provider. Any amounts over the Recognized Amount, Usual and Customary amount, Negotiated Rate or established fee schedule that this Plan pays. . The Third Party Administrators do not assume liability for benefits payable under this Plan, since they are solely claims-paying agents for the Plan Administrator. The employer assumes the sole responsibility for funding the Plan benefits out of general assets; however, Employees help cover some of the costs of covered benefits through contributions, Deductibles, out-of-pocket amounts, and Plan Participation amounts as described in the Schedule of Benefits. All claim payments and reimbursements are paid out of the general assets of the employer and there is no separate fund that is used to pay promised benefits\n"
