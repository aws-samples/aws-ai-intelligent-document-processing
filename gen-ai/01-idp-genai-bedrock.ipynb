OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES AND MAXIMUMS Benefit Plan(s) 003, 004 DEDUCTIBLES A Deductible is an amount of money paid once per Plan Year by the Covered Person before any Covered Expenses are paid by this Plan. A Deductible applies to each Covered Person up to a family Deductible limit. When a new Plan Year begins, a new Deductible must be satisfied. Deductible amounts are shown on the Schedule of Benefits. Generally, the applicable Deductible must be met before any benefits will be paid under this Plan. However, certain covered benefits may be considered Preventive / Routine Care and paid first dollar. The Deductible amounts that the Covered Person Incurs for Covered Expenses, including covered Pharmacy expenses, will be used to satisfy the Deductible(s) shown on the Schedule of Benefits. The Deductible amounts that the Covered Person Incurs at an in-network provider will apply to the in- network total individual and family Deductible. The Deductible amounts that the Covered Person Incurs at an out-of-network provider will apply to the out-of-network total individual and family Deductible. NO FORGIVENESS OF OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES The Covered Person is required to pay the out-of-pocket expenses (including Deductibles, Co-pays or required Plan Participation) under the terms of this Plan. The requirement that You and Your Dependent(s) pay the applicable out-of-pocket expenses cannot be waived by a provider under any \"fee forgiveness\", \"not out-of-pocket\" or similar arrangement. If a provider waives the required out-of-pocket expenses, the Covered Person's claim may be denied and the Covered Person will be responsible for payment of the entire claim. The claim(s) may be reconsidered if the Covered Person provides satisfactory proof that he or she paid the out-of-pocket expenses under the terms of this Plan.

The plan has co-pays for certain services that do not apply to deductibles but do apply to OOP maxes. After meeting your deductible, you pay coinsurance until reaching your OOP max.
