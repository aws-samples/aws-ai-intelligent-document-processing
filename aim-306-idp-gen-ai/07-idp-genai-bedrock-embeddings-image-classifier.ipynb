    "# Conclusion\n",
    "As demonstrated here, by using Amazon Titan multimodal embeddings we are able to create a gallery of images that we can then use for similarity search to help identify the type of document we have in hand. One of the advantages of using a vector DB containing embeddings is that we can quickly add a new set of embeddings from new documents to our gallery in near real-time to further refine our similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "During our testing we found this solution works very well when documents have certain unique characteristics. For example, invoices that might be processed that are received from various vendors. Each vendors invoice will typically have a certain look and feel to it like the way the line items are laid out, or having the vendor logo somewhere on the invoice. Image embeddings will achieve good results with this type of vendor classification. Where results might be more challenging is when we have documents that are dense with text from top to bottom. In this scenario it might be better to use a NLP such as Amazon Comprehend to classify on text or use a few shot prompt with an LLM."
